Okay, so now I want to talk through some changes I want to make to the Admin Application and Admin Dashboard, although we are off to a good start. So I would like to change where it says Companies to Prospects and add a tab called Clients. So for the prospects tab, I want to have, I guess where when you first go it has all the prospects, and then it has either filter by filter by location or status like you currently have, but instead of just saying Little Rock, Arkansas and Birmingham, Alabama, it should say Arkansas and then Alabama, and then below that have a a like I guess like a optional drop down from there where you click on a city and it takes to those, although all we have right now is just the Little Rock, just verify if you understand what I'm hoping for or not. And then, I guess where it says Status in the, and it says Prospects in the Companies tab, which, you know, want to change to Prospects tab, should say, like, Status New Lead at first. And then, I guess, one of the other things where it says, like, Name, Location, Status, Last Contact Actions, it should have their phone number on there I would also like to add tags referencing some of the columns from the CSV. So, for example, column D, it says Site, which is their existing website right now. So, if one of us filtered a click with site, it should only show the ones with a site. The next tag would be column AJ, where it says phone.phones underscore enricher dot carrier underscore type. Notice how it says mobile landline toll underscore free fixed line or is blank. I just want the tag to say mobile and only show the ones with a mobile phone number. And then finally, I would like, if you notice where it says column CO email underscore 1, if they do have an email address there, to say, and also if it's receiving where it says in column CP emails underscore 1 dot emails underscore validator dot status that says receiving there, and they have one in email underscore 1 in column CO to have a tag that says maybe active email, and yeah. So, please give me an explanation of if you think you know what I want currently before coding this.
